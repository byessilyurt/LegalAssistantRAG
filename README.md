# Polish Law for Foreigners

An interactive web application that helps foreigners understand Polish law by answering questions in any language using AI.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: React application with Auth0 authentication
- **Backend**: FastAPI server that handles user authentication and chat functionality

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file based on the example:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Update the `.env` file with your Auth0 credentials.

6. Run the server:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Update the Auth0 configuration in `src/auth0-config.js` with your Auth0 credentials.

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Auth0 Setup

1. Create an Auth0 account at https://auth0.com/

2. Create a new application of type "Single Page Application"

3. Configure the following settings:
   - Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Allowed Logout URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Allowed Web Origins: `http://localhost:3000`

4. Create a new API in Auth0:
   - Name: Polish Law for Foreigners API
   - Identifier: `https://api.polishlawforeigner.com`

5. Update the frontend and backend configuration with your Auth0 credentials.
