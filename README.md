# Polish Law for Foreigners with AI

An AI-powered application to help foreigners understand Polish legal procedures and requirements.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: React application deployed on Vercel
- **Backend**: FastAPI application deployed on Render
- **RAG System**: Retrieval Augmented Generation for answering legal questions

## Deployment Architecture

This project uses a split deployment architecture:

1. **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel
   - Static site hosting for the React application
   - Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard

2. **Backend**: Deployed on Render
   - FastAPI application
   - Handles the RAG system for answering legal questions
   - Manages conversations and authentication

## Development Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp env.example .env  # Edit with your OpenAI API key
python run.py
```

The backend will be available at http://localhost:8000.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp env.local.example .env.local  # Edit if necessary
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Deployment

### Automatic Deployment

The project is configured for automatic deployment using GitHub integration:

1. **Frontend**: Connected to Vercel for automatic deployment on push to the main branch
2. **Backend**: Connected to Render for automatic deployment using the render.yaml file
